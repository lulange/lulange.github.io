      <h1>The CFCE method</h1>
      <p><strong>CFCE or Cross, First 2 layers, Corners of last layer, and Edges of last layer is a speedsolving method that uses CFOP style first two layers and finishes with CLL/Ell instead of OLL/PLL.</strong></p>
    </header>

<!-- Pros and Cons plus the steps: a general overview of the method -->
    <h4>Pros:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Less algs than CFOP</li>
      <li>Slightly lower average turn count for each solve</li>
      <li>CLL is a 2x2 speedsolving method as well so you learn two methods in one</li>
      <li>If transitioning from CFOP you can keep most F2L strategies</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Cons:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Harder to learn recognition</li>
      <li>Not used by many people</li>
      <li>Doesn't have as catchy of a name as CFOP</li>
      <li>influencing edges with F2L does not really help as many of the CLL algs will mess with the LL edges</li>
    </ul>

<!-- a simple description of the most intuitive part of the solve -->
    <h2 id="cross">The cross:</h2>
    <p>This step should be fairly easy as it is the same as most beginner methods as well as CFOP. All you have to do is solve all the edges of one side (usually the white). <br>This step can take anywhere from 0-12 turns.</p>

<!-- another simple description, mostly because this is not the main focus of the webpage. though may be improved later -->
    <h2 id="F2L">First two layers:</h2>
    <p>This step is done by inserting a corner then inserting the matching equator layer edge. F2L can be done using anywhere from 0-41 algorithms.<br> If you would like to learn more about F2L either look up intuitive F2L on youtube or go <a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/First_Two_Layers">here</a> for F2L algs.</p>

<!-- the largest part of the webpage and the most important. this is a list of my CLL algs that I use -->
    <h2 id="CLL">CLL:</h2>
    <p>CLL has 42 cases separated by the corner pattern into 8 groups. For a complete list of the CLL algorithms that I use, click <a href="../CFCE/CLL/index.html">here</a>. For more CLL algs, try the speedsolving.com wiki or just click <a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/CLL_algorithms_(3x3x3)">here</a>.</p>



    <h2 id="ELL">ELL:</h2>
    <p>ELL has a total of 29 cases 4 of which are PLLs and the rest are PLLs with edge flips except for the 3 pure-flips.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>The CFCE method has 71-112 depending on the number of F2L cases memorized but its main pro is that it has fewer total algs than CFOP while maintaining a similar or lower average turn count.</p>
