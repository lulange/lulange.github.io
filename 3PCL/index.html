      <h1>The 3PCL method</h1>
      <p><strong>3PCL or 3 bottom layer edges, Pairs (corner edge pairs like F2L), Corners of last layer, and Last 5 edges is a speedsolving method that is basically a mix of roux and CFOP so that blockbuilding is avoided.</strong></p>
    </header>

<!-- Pros and Cons plus the steps: a general overview of the method -->
    <h4>Pros:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Less algs than CFOP</li>
      <li>Easier first step inspection</li>
      <li>CLL is a 2x2 speedsolving method as well so you learn two methods in one</li>
      <li>If transitioning from CFOP you can keep most F2L strategies</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Cons:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Harder to learn recognition (for CLL)</li>
      <li>Not used by anyone but me</li>
      <li>Influencing edges with F2L does not really help as many of the CLL algs will mess with the LL edges</li>
      <li>Somewhat of a high turn count compared to some speedsolving methods</li>
    </ul>

<!-- a simple description of the most intuitive part of the solve -->
    <h2 id="3BL">3 bottom layer edges:</h2>
    <p>This step should be fairly easy as it is similar to most beginner methods as well as CFOP. All you have to do is solve 3 of the edges of one side (usually the white). <br>This step can take anywhere from 0-6 turns.</p>
    <p class="avg-turns">This step should take 3-6 turns</p>

<!-- another simple description, mostly because this is not the main focus of the webpage. though may be improved later -->
    <h2 id="Pairs">Pairs:</h2>
    <p>This step is basically F2L from CFOP with one edge out so that some more cases are possible and some shortcuts are possible. F2L can be done using anywhere from 0-41 algorithms.<br> If you would like to learn more about F2L either look up intuitive F2L on youtube or go <a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/First_Two_Layers">here</a> for F2L algs.</p>
    <p class="avg-turns">This step should take 20-30 turns</p>

<!-- the largest part of the webpage and the most important. this is a list of my CLL algs that I use -->
    <h2 id="CLL">CLL:</h2>
    <p>CLL has 42 cases separated by the corner pattern into 8 groups. For a complete list of the CLL algorithms that I use, click <a href="../CFCE/CLL/index.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p class="avg-turns">This step averages 11 turns</p>

    <h2 id="L5E">L5E:</h2>
    <p>L5E has two substeps. First L5EO or Last 5 Edges Orientation which has only five quick cases. Second L5EP or Last 5 Edges Permutation which has only 16 equally quick cases.</p>
    <p class="avg-turns">This step averages 15 turns</p>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>The 3PCL method has only 63 algorithms for the last layer and the Pairs step can be done mostly intuitively. The Pairs step and the 3 bottom layer edges step are both hard to have a specific average on, but for me I think it is about 5 for 3BLE and 25-30 for Pairs, giving me an average of 57-62 turns total.</p>
    <p class="avg-turns">Turns per solve average 55-65 turns</p>
